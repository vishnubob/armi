/** @mainpage Welcome

The latest version of Mozzi and this documentation are at the <a href="http://sensorium.github.com/Mozzi/">Mozzi home page.</a>

Here's a brief description of each section of this documentation:

@section Modules
Fixed point number types, macros and functions for fast fractional maths.

Mozzi core definitions and functions, which are used in every Mozzi sketch.

Utility functions which are generally useful, including midi note to frequency conversion.

@section Classes
The Classes used to generate control and audio signals.

@section  Files
Files lists ready-to-use wave tables which are in the Mozzi/tables folder.

You can also convert your own sounds from a program like
Audacity to tables for Mozzi with a script called char2mozzi.py, in Mozzi/python.

Read the char2mozzi.py file for instructions.

AUDIO_RATE is fixed at 16384 Hz for now.
This is a compromise between the sample rate (interrupt rate) and sample
bitdepth (pwm width), which are interdependent due to the way pulse wave
modulation is used to generate the sound output. With the AUDIO_RATE at 16384,
the sample resolution is 488, which provides some headroom above the 8bit table
resolution currently used by the oscillators. You can look at the TimerOne
library for more info about how interrupt rate and pwm resolution relate.

/** @ingroup core
This is the maximum sample resolution. 8 bit (ie. 256) is usually fine but
there might be times where the extra headroom is useful. Use powers of two in
audio calculations and use right shifts for divisions where possible. Also, in
tests while writing Mozzi, shifts on byte boundaries seem to work fastest.
For example, >> 8 is faster than >> 4. Test your timings where possible, using
an oscilloscope.  To test timing, include utils.h in your sketch, put SET_PIN13_OUT
in setup(), then SET_PIN13_HIGH and SET_PIN13_LOW around your test code
(see <a href="group__util.html">Mozzi utility functions</a>).
