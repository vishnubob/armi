/** Oscil plays a wavetable, cycling through the table to generate an audio or
control signal. The frequency of the signal can be set or changed with
setFreq(), and the output of an Oscil can be produced with next() for a simple
cycling oscillator, or atIndex() for a particular sample in the table.
@tparam NUM_TABLE_CELLS This is defined in the table ".h" file the Oscil will be
using. It's important that it's a power of 2, and either a literal number (eg. "8192") or a
defined macro, rather than a const or int, for the Oscil to run fast enough.
@tparam UPDATE_RATE This will be AUDIO_RATE if the Oscil is updated in
updateAudio(), or CONTROL_RATE if it's updated each time updateControl() is
called. It could also be a fraction of CONTROL_RATE if you are doing some kind
of cyclic updating in updateControl(), for example, to spread out the processor load.
@todo Use conditional compilation to optimise setFreq() variations for different table
sizes.
@note If you #define DITHER_OSCIL_PHASE before you #include <Oscil.h>,
the phase increments will be dithered, which reduces spurious frequency spurs
in the audio output, at the cost of some extra processing and memory.
