Mozzi Resources: these lists will grow


Synthesis - ways to use or extend Mozzi
- Practical synthesis tutorials- http://www.obiwannabe.co.uk/html/music/6SS/six-simple-synthesisers.html
- Lots of dsp code- http://www.musicdsp.org/showmany.php
- fixed-point dsp for avr with a focus on speed- https://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/ee476/Math/avrDSP.htm


General information/background
- Laboratory for Experimental Computer Science at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne - http://interface.khm.de/index.php/lab/experiments/
	Good arduino audio dsp explanations, and hardware output filter schematics (though they need to be adjusted for Mozzi sample rate)


Hardware
- RC Low-pass Filter Design Tool for PWM - http://sim.okawa-denshi.jp/en/PWMtool.php
