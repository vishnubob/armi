/** A simple low pass filter for smoothing control signals. This algorithm comes
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter: y[i] := y[i-1] + Î± * (x[i] -
y[i-1]), translated as out = last_out + a * (in - last_out). It's not calibrated
to any real-world update rate, so if you use it at CONTROL_RATE and you change
CONTROL_RATE, you'll need to adjust the smoothness value to suit.
@tparam T the type of numbers being smoothed.  Watch out for numbers overflowing the
internal calculations. Some experimentation is recommended.
If this can't be overcome using different settings or values, LowPass1stOrder may be another option.
@note Timing: ~5us for 16 bit types, ~1us for 8 bit types.
